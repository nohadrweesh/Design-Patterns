# Design Patterns:
Typical solutions for common problems in software design

# Types:

## Creational:

- These patterns provides various objects creation mechanism
  
## Structural:

- These patterns explain how to assmeble classes and objects into larger structure   



### Bridge
- The Bridge pattern helps split a large class into 2 separate hireachies  abstraction and implementation

- Remember Cartisean Product s1 {A,B} , s2 {1,2} ==>> {(A,1),(A,2),(B,1),(B,2)}
- so instead of making the 4 output classes , we make 2 separate sets so we can increase in the separate directions



## Behavioral:

- These patterns are concerned with algorithms and responsibilities assignment between objects
